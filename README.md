# EDF R&D implementation of ISO 15118-20
============


evDriveFlow is a *Python* implementation of the communication prococol between charging station communication controllers (SECC) and electric vehicles communication controllers (EVCC) based on ISO 15118-20 Ed. 1. 

This implementation integrates a model of the EV charging process in order to run a charging session. The project is coupled to a Graphical user interface to visualize the session information and control the charging status.

Supported features:
- DC Bidirectional Power Transfer BPT with dynamic control mode.
- TLS 1.3 with mutual authentication. [NOT RECOMMENDED : can be disabled for testing purposes by modifying SECURITY_PROTOCOL in shared/global_values.py ]
- Set departure time from SECC side.


# Project setup 


## Installation and setup for Ubuntu

Update your system using the command below:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```
### 1. Install MiniConda

Visit the conda installation website [link](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) to install MiniConda according to your operating system.

If your operating system is Ubuntu, you can visit this [link](https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/miniconda) and follow instructions.  

Next, to activate the command **conda**, execute the line below:
```bash
export PATH="[YOUR PATH OF INSTALLED MINICONDA]/bin":$PATH
```
Example path: */home/miniconda3/bin/*

To install conda's shell functions for easier access, once **conda** command is activated, then: 
```bash
conda init bash
```

### 2. Install PyCharm

Install by Terminal:
```bash
sudo snap install pycharm-community --classic
```
Or you can download the installer via the following link: [Download PyCharm Community for Ubuntu](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/download-thanks.html?platform=linux&code=PCC)

Extract the downloaded file in [YOUR EXTRACTED DIRECTORY OF PYCHARM]. Then, to open PyCharm, run in Terminal : 

```bash
cd [YOUR EXTRACTED DIRECTORY OF PYCHARM]
./pycharm-community-2021.3.1/bin/pycharm.sh
```
### 3. Install Java

This proyect uses OpenEXI for decode/encode xml to EXI. This is a java library, which has been coupled to python using jPype. Since the project imports java libraries, it is required to install JDK. For installing JDK follow the instructions [here](https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html)

For Ubuntu/Debian, you can follow instructions [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-java-with-apt-on-ubuntu-20-04)

### 4. Create virtual environment and install dependencies

First of all, it is necessary to download/clone the project from github.

In Terminal:
```bash
cd [YOUR DOWNLOADED DIRECTORY OF PROJECT]
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Normally, all of project's dependencies are installed automatically when setting virtual environment. 

### 5. Setup virtual environment
#### From command line
To activate your new virtual environment in Terminal,run the command below:
```bash
conda activate edf15118-20
```
#### From PyCharm


**Step 1:**  
Add your new virtual environment and interpreter in PyCharm:

In *Python Interpreter* on bottom right corner of windows, choose *Add Interpreter...* like the screen shot below

![](/doc/figures/python_version.png?raw=true)

**Step 2:** 

In the popup window, choose your Python interpreter of edf15118-20 environment. 

The environment is located in [YOUR PATH OF INSTALLED MINICONDA]/envs/

Then choose the package **python** of **edf15118-20** virtual environment.

For example, the complete Python Interpreter path is: 

*/home/miniconda3/envs/edf15118-20/bin/python*

## Installation and setup for Raspberry Pi

### 1. Install VSCode:
Install with the command line below:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install code
```
### 2. Install dependencies:
First, install PyQt5 independently with the following command :
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5
```
Next, install all remaining dependencies as below:
```bash
pip install -r requirement_rasp.txt
```
### 3. Install missing packages
Some packages are not installed automatically via *requirement_rasp.txt*.
To execute the project, it is required to install these librairies manually via the command below:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev libhdf5-dev libhdf5-serial-dev libatlas-base-dev libjasper-dev
```
### 4. Setup Python for VSCode:
In VSCode, press Ctrl+Shift+X to install Python extension then select Python interpreter



### 5. Install Java
Follow the same steps of Linux PC.

## Execute EVCC and SECC
### 1. Setup configuration files config.ini: 

From the terminal, check for network interfaces by using the following command: 
```bash
ifconfig
```
For example, the result returned by *ifconfig*:
```bash
enp0s3: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 10.0.2.15  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 10.0.2.255
        inet6 fe80::1c00:5e0f:2cb2:e69f  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether 08:00:27:e4:6d:1b  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 277  bytes 39834 (39.8 KB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 1110  bytes 92105 (92.1 KB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

lo: flags=73<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING>  mtu 65536
        inet 127.0.0.1  netmask 255.0.0.0
        inet6 ::1  prefixlen 128  scopeid 0x10<host>
        loop  txqueuelen 1000  (Local Loopback)
        RX packets 475  bytes 42714 (42.7 KB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 475  bytes 42714 (42.7 KB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```
Setup the configuration file an interface which has ipv6 address. In this case, we will use **enp0s3** interface.

#### EVSE :
In file *evse_config.ini*, setup the parameters as shown below:
```
[NETWORK]
    interface = enp0s3
    tcp_port = 49152
    # See table 10, must range from 49152 to 65535

[SETTINGS]
    virtual_mode = true
```
The parameter **virtual_mode** in **[SETTINGS]**, allows to set and verify the 61851-1 states from a communication card.To simulate the communication card the virtual_mode parmeter can be set to true.

If it is required to verify or set  61851-1 states, some adaptations of the provided interfaces are needed to read and set the states from the communication card.

#### EVCC :
Setup configuration file *ev_config.ini*, as follows:
```
[NETWORK]
    interface = enp0s3
    udp_port = 49153
    # See table 18, must range from 49152 to 65535
    tcp_port = 49154
    # See table 10, must range from 49152 to 65535

[SETTINGS]
    virtual_mode = true
```
Like EVSE, you set *virtual_mode = true/false* based on your own situation. 

### 2. Install certificates for mutual authentication
Before running ISO 15118-20, you need to install the certificates for TLS with mutual authentication by running the command below in the terminal:
```bash
cd /shared/certificates/
```
and then run :
```bash
sh generateCertificates.sh
```
### 3. Run ISO 15118-20
To run  a communication session, the server which corresponds to the SECC needs to be running first:
 - If you run using the GUI, go to directory /secc run *python3 evse_gui.py*
	 - In GUI, click **Set** to define a departure time and target state of charge SoC from the charging station side and then click **Start**

![Start Window SECC](/doc/figures/SECC_StartWindow.png?raw=true)

 - If you run without GUI, run *start_evse.py*
 
Then, you can run electric vehicle communication controller EVCC: 
 - If you execute with GUI, go to directory /evcc and execute *python3 ev_gui.py*
- In GUI, click **Set** to define a departure time and target state of charge SoC from the EV and then click **Start**

![Start Window EVCC](/doc/figures/EVCC_StartWindow.png?raw=true)

 - To execute without GUI, run *start_ev.py*. To stop the session from EV side press Enter in the excution terminal.

The session sequence can be seen in the terminal by the printed logs or in the GUI, in the information tab.

![Information tab EVCC](/doc/figures/SECC_ChargingSession.png?raw=true)

 Once the session is in the charging loop you can control dinamically the power transfer by moving the control bar at the left side of the SECC control window:

 ![Control Window SECC](/doc/figures/SECC_ControlWindow.png?raw=true)

 
  To stop the charging session, click on stop button of the EVCC start window.

## Generate documentation
------------------------
In order to generate the documentation, one has to use the **sphinx** module from the *docs* directory:

```bash
    make html
```
## Troubleshoot

 *Note:* If you have the error message below when runing the project: 
```
qt.qpa.plugin: Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb" in "" even though it was found.
This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.

Available platform plugins are: eglfs, linuxfb, minimal, minimalegl, offscreen, vnc, xcb.

Aborted (core dumped)
```
This error comes from the library *libxcb* which is used in package *Qt* for GUI. To fix it, you need to re-install this library with the command below:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libxcb-randr0-dev libxcb-xtest0-dev libxcb-xinerama0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xkb-dev
```
### IMPORTANT!!
Also, inside the module `matplotlib`, add this at line `1742` of:
```
.venv\Lib\site-packages\matplotlib\backend_bases.py
```
At the end of `FigureCanvasBase`'s `__init__()`: instead of
```python
super().__init__()  # Typically the GUI widget init (if any).
```
put this instead:
```python
if type(self).__module__ == "shared.custom_canvas":
    super().__init__(fig=figure)
else:
    super().__init__()  # Typically the GUI widget init (if any).
```
This might be a bug in `matplotlib`, as the wrong `super().__init__()` gets called.
